    	  	    <p> In recent years, the swift expansion of Internet of Things    	  	      (IoT) applications has been notable. However, developing a
    	  	      comprehensive IoT application is highly challenging for nonexpert developers due to the highly diverse characteristics of    	  	      embedded operating systems. LLM-based methods provide    	  	      a paradigm for code generation through natural language,    	  	      which can greatly simplify and accelerate the development    	  	      of IoT applications. While promising, existing works have    	  	      failed to account for the specific characteristics of embedded    	  	      operating system, resulting in the lower quality of generated    	  	      IoT code.    	  	      In this paper, we present IoTPilot, an LLM-driven embedded IoT programming tool. We have observed that the    	  	      conflicts between LLM internal APIs/headers and external    	  	      OS-specific APIs/headers are key factors leading to the low    	  	      quality of generated embedded IoT applications. Thus, we    	  	      introduce two effective self-thinking chains to integrate internal LLM knowledge with external documentation, addressing conflicts in APIs and headers. We provide embedded IoT    	  	      benchmarks (IoTEval), which include 45 embedded IoT applications built on RIOT, Zephyr, and Contiki OS. Results    	  	      show that IoTPilot can improve the performance of IoT code    	  	      generation on all the three embedded OSes compared with    	  	      existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. <br>

    	  	    <p>Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and LoRa are two dominant wireless protocols for the Internet of Things (IoT), each built with specific design goals, rendering them non-interoperable. 
Cross-Technology Communication (CTC) enables heterogeneous communication between BLE and LoRa. 
Despite these efforts, existing works suffer from low throughput and short communication range.
In this paper, we present a novel system named BoRa, which enables bi-directional communication between the COTS BLE and COTS LoRa chips. 
BoRa can be readily run on COTS chips without any hardware modifications.
We implement and evaluate \textit{BoRa} with COTS BLE and LoRa chips.
The results show that \textit{BoRa} enables bi-directional cross-technology communication between COTS BLE and COTS LoRa chips, and long-range communication between two COTS BLE chips. 
It achieves up to 1500m communication range while ensuring 10~Kb/s throughput in outdoor Line-Of-Sight (LOS) scenarios.
Besides, BoRa has up to 18.41~Kb/s higher throughput and up to 98.26% lower energy consumption compared with state-of-the-art methods.</p>

    	  	    <p>Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is one of the most popular wireless
protocols for building IoT applications because of its low energy,
low cost, and wide compatibility nature. However, BLE communication
performance can be easily affected by blockages because of its
low transmission power. This paper presents BLEW, a technique to
improve the BLE communication performance over weak links by
exploiting adaptive symbol extension to combat channel interference
and maximize network throughput. This paper addresses two
key challenges. First, we propose a phase peak clustering-based approach
for accurate preamble detection. It exploits the phase difference
between sample points and coherently adds up the phase difference
over the whole preamble to form a cluster with prominent
phase peaks. After that, we propose a multi-domain DNN-based
demodulator to enhance the symbol demodulation performance
with low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). It fully extracts the temporal
and spectrum features of the signal and effectively decodes BLE
symbols. Furthermore, we model the BLE throughput considering
the physical layer details of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) BLE
chips, which can be used to choose the optimal symbol length
according to the channel conditions. We implement BLEW with
USRP B210 and COTS Nordic nRF52840 platform. The experiment
shows BLEW can increase throughput up to 149.78 Kb/s compared
with the native BLE. The phase peak clustering-based preamble
detection method has an 8.27%-19.15% higher preamble detection
rate and the DNN-based demodulator can bring up to 3.36 dB gain
compared with existing methods.</p>

    	  	    <p>Trigger-Action Program (TAP) is a simple but powerful format to realize intelligent IoT applications, especially in home
automation scenarios. Existing trace-driven approaches and in-situ programming approaches depend on either customized
interaction commands or well-labeled datasets, resulting in limited applicable scenarios. In this paper, we propose ChatIoT, a
zero-code TAP generation system based on large language models (LLMs). With a novel context-aware compressive prompting
scheme, ChatIoT is able to automatically generate TAPs from user requests in a token-efficient manner and deploy them to the
TAP runtime. Further, for those TAP requests including unknown sensing abilities, ChatIoT can also generate new AI models
with knowledge distillation by multimodal LLMs, with a novel model customization method based on deep reinforcement
learning. We implemented ChatIoT and evaluated its performance extensively. Results show that ChatIoT can reduce token
consumption by 26.1-84.9% and improve TAP generation accuracy by 4.2-65.5% compared to state-of-the-art approaches in
multiple settings. We also conducted a real user study, and ChatIoT can achieve 91.57% TAP generation accuracy.</p>

    	  	    <p>Encrypted Docker images are becoming increasingly popular in Docker registries for privacy. As the Docker registry is tasked with managing an increasing number of images, it becomes essential to implement deduplication to conserve storage space. However, deduplication for encrypted images is difficult because deduplication exploits identical content, while encryption tries to make all contents look random. Existing state-of-the-art works try to decompress images and perform message-locked encryption (MLE) to deduplicate encrypted images. Unfortunately, our measurements uncover two limitations in current works: (i) even minor modifications to the image content can hinder MLE deduplication, (ii) decompressing image layers would increase the size of the storage for duplicate data, and significantly compromise user pull latency and deduplication throughput. In this paper, we propose SimEnc, a high-performance similarity-preserving encryption approach for deduplication of encrypted Docker images. SimEnc is the first work that integrates the semantic hash technique into MLE to extract semantic information among layers for improving the deduplication ratio. SimEnc builds on a fast similarity space selection mechanism for flexibility. Unlike existing works completely decompressing the layer, we explore a new similarity space by Huffman decoding that achieves a better deduplication ratio and performance. Experiments show that SimEnc outperforms both the state-of-the-art encrypted serverless platform and plaintext Docker registry, reducing storage consumption by up to 261.7% and 54.2%, respectively. Meanwhile, SimEnc can surpass them in terms of pull latency.</p>

    	  	    <p>Internet of Things (IoT) applications have recently been widely
used in safety-critical scenarios. To prevent sensitive information
leaks, IoT device vendors provide hardware-assisted protections,
called Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), like ARM Trust-
Zone. Programming a TEE-based application requires separate code
for two components, significantly slowing down the development
process. Existing solutions tackle this issue by automatic code partition
while not successfully applying it in two complicated scenarios:
adding trusted logic and interactions with secure peripherals.
We propose dTEE, a declarative approach to secure IoT applications
based on TrustZone. dTEE proposes a rapid approach that enables
developers to declare tiered-sensitive variables and functions
of existing applications. Besides, dTEE automatically transforms
device drivers into trusted ones. We evaluate dTEE on four realworld
IoT applications and seven micro-benchmarks. Results show
that dTEE achieves high expressiveness for supporting 50% more
applications than existing approaches and reduces 90% of the lines
of code against handcrafted development.</p>

    	  	    <p>With the increasing demand for Web of Things (WoT) and edge computing, the efficient utilization of limited computing power on edge devices is becoming a crucial challenge.
Traditional neural networks (NNs) as web services rely on deterministic computational resources. 
However, they may fail to output the results on non-deterministic computing power which could be preempted at any time, degrading the task performance significantly.
Multi-exit NNs with multiple branches have been proposed as a solution, but the accuracy of intermediate results may be unsatisfactory. 
In this paper, we propose MEEdge, a system that automatically transforms classic single-exit models into heterogeneous and dynamic multi-exit models which enables Memory-Elastic inference at the Edge with non-deterministic computing power.
To build heterogeneous multi-exit models, MEEdge uses efficient convolutions to form a branch zoo and High Priority First (HPF)-based branch placement method for branch growth.
To adapt models to dynamically varying computational resources, we employ a novel on-device scheduler for collaboration.
Further, to reduce the memory overhead caused by dynamic branches, we propose neuron-level weight sharing and few-shot knowledge distillation (KD) retraining.
Our experimental results show that models generated by MEEdge can achieve up to 27.31% better performance than existing multi-exit NNs.</p>

    	  	    <p>Mobile application updates occur frequently, and
they continue to add considerable traffic over the Internet.
Differencing algorithms, which compute a small delta between
the new version and the old version, are often employed to reduce
the update overhead. Transforming the old and new files into the
decoded similarity spaces can drastically reduce the delta size.
However, this transformation is often hindered by two practical
reasons: (1) insufficient decoding (2) long recompression time. To
address this challenge, we have proposed two general approaches
to transforming the compressed files (more specifically, deflate
stream) into the full decoded similarity space and partially
decoded similarity space, with low recompression time. The first
approach uses recompression-aware searching mechanism, based
on a general full decoding tool to transform deflate stream to
the full decoded similarity space with a configurable searching
complexity, even when it cannot be recompressed identically.
The second approach uses a novel solution to transform a
deflate stream into the partial decoded similarity space with
differencing-friendly LZ77 token reencoding. We have also proposed
an algorithm called MDiffPatch to exploit the full and
partial decoded similarity spaces. The algorithm can well balance
compression ratio and recompression time by exposing a tunable
parameter. Extensive evaluation results show that MDiffPatch
achieves lower compression ratio than state-of-the-art algorithms
and its tunable parameter allows us to achieve a good tradeoff
between compression ratio and recompression time.</p>

    	  	    <p>In recent years, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has
become one of the most wildly used wireless protocols and it
is common that users carry one or more BLE devices. With
the extensive deployment of BLE devices, there is a significant
privacy risk if these BLE devices can be tracked. However,
the common wisdom suggests that the risk of BLE location
tracking is negligible. The reason is that researchers believe there
are no stable BLE fingerprints that are stable across different
scenarios (e.g., temperatures) for different BLE devices with the
same model. In this paper, we introduce a novel physical-layer
fingerprint named Transient Dynamic Fingerprint (TDF), which
originated from the negative feedback control process of the
frequency synthesizer. Because of the hardware imperfection,
the dynamic features of the frequency synthesizer are different,
making TDF unique among different devices, even with the same
model. Furthermore, TDF keeps stable under different thermal
conditions. Based on TDF, we propose BTrack, a practical BLE
device tracking system and evaluate its tracking performance in
different environments. The results show BTrack works well once
BLE beacons are effectively received. The identification accuracy
is 35.38%-57.41% higher than the existing method, and stable
over temperatures, distances, and locations.</p>

different radio technologies. In this paper, we design and implement
TinyNet, a lightweight, modular, and unified network architecture
for representative low-power radio technologies including 802.15.4,

simplify the creation of new protocols by selecting specific modules
in TinyNet. We implement TinyNet on realistic IoT nodes including
TI CC2650 and Heltec IoT LoRa nodes. We perform extensive
evaluations. Results show that TinyNet (1) allows interoperability
at or above the network layer; (2) allows code reuse for multi-
protocol co-existence and simplifies new protocol design by module
composition; (3) has small code size and memory footprint.</p>

WebAssembly,  known  for  its  performance and  portability,  is  considered  a  promising  technology  to  bridge the  heterogeneity  between  devices  and  the  server.  Nevertheless,the resource-constrained devices, which are commonly deployedin   the   wild,   are   difficult   to   participate   in   this   device-cloud integration because it could hardly run WebAssembly efficiently. Hence,  we  propose  WAIT,  a lightweight WebAssembly  runtimeon  resource-constrained  IoT  devices  for  device-cloud  integrated applications. WAIT is the first work to enable the Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation of WebAssembly on resource-constrained devices by leveraging several approaches to reduce memory usage. Moreover,  WAIT  introduces  various  safety  checks  at  compile-time  to  guarantee  the  sandbox  execution  of  WebAssembly  and optimizes energy consumption for IoT devices. Results show that WAIT achieves 84.8×lower RAM usage compared with the state-of-the-art  WebAssembly  AOT  runtime,  and  reduces  1.2×~4.9×energy consumption while guaranteeing the sandboxed execution of  WebAssembly  modules.</p>

    	  	    <p>Programming a complete IoT application usually
requires separated programming for device, edge and/or cloud
sides, which slows down the development process and makes the
project hardly portable. Existing solutions tackle this problem
by proposing a single coherent language while leaving two issues
unsolved: efficient migration among the three sides and the
platform dependency of the binaries.
We propose WiProg, an integrated approach to IoT application
programming based on WebAssembly. WiProg proposes
an edge-centric programming approach that enables developers
to write the IoT application as if it runs on the edge. This
is achieved by the peripheral-accessing SDKs and annotations
specifying the computation placement. WiProg automatically
processes the program to insert auxiliary code and then compile
it to WebAssembly At runtime, WiProg leverages dynamic code
offloading with compact memory snapshotting to achieve efficient
execution. WiProg also provides interfaces for the customization
of offloading policies. Results on real-world applications and computation
benchmarks show that WIPROG achieves an average
reduction by 18.7%~54.3% and 20.1%~57.6% in terms of energy
consumption and execution time.</p>

    	  	    <p>Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs)
emerges as attractive communication technologies to connect the
Internet-of-Things. A new LoRa chip has been proposed to provide
long range and low power support on 2.4GHz. Comparing
with previous LoRa radios operating on sub-gigahertz, the new
one can transmit LoRa packets faster without strict channel
duty cycle limitations and have attracted many attentions. Prior
studies have shown that LoRa packets may suffer from severe
corruptions with WiFi interference. However, there are many
limitations in existing approaches such as too much signal
processing overhead on weak devices or low detection accuracy.
In this paper, we propose a novel weak signal detection approach,
LoFi, to enable the coexistence of LoRa and WiFi. LoFi utilizes a
typical physical phenomenon Stochastic Resonance (SR) to boost
weak signals with a specific frequency by adding appropriate
white noise. Based on the detected spectrum occupancy of LoRa
signals, LoFi reserves the spectrum for LoRa transmissions.
We implement LoFi on USRP N210 and conduct extensive
experiments to evaluate its performance. Results show that LoFi
can enable the coexistence of LoRa and WiFi in 2.4GHz. The
packet reception ratio of LoRa achieves 98% over an occupied
20MHz WiFi channel, and the WiFi throughput loss is reduced
by up to 13%.</p>

    	  	    <p>With the increasing relevance of the Internet of Things (IoT) and large-scale Location-Based Services (LBS), LoRa localization has been attractive due to its low cost, low power and long range properties. However, existing localization approaches based on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) are either easily affected by signal fading of different land-cover types or labor-intensive. In this work, we propose SateLoc, a LoRa localization system that utilizes satellite images to generate virtual fingerprints. Specifically, SateLoc first uses high-resolution satellite images to identify land- cover types. With the path loss parameters of each land-cover type, SateLoc can automatically generate a virtual fingerprinting map for each gateway. We then propose a novel multi-gateway combination strategy, which is weighted by the environment interference of each gateway, to produce a joint likelihood distribution for localization. We implement SateLoc with commercial LoRa devices without any hardware modification, and evaluate its performance in a 227,500m2 urban area. Experimental results show that SateLoc achieves a median localization error of 47.1m, improving more than 40% compared to the state-of-the-art model-based approaches. More importantly, compared to the fingerprinting-based approach, SateLoc does not require the labor-intensive fingerprint acquisition process.

    	  	    <p>The recent years have witnessed the rapid growth of IoT (Internet
of Things) applications. A typical IoT application usually consists
of three essential parts: the device side, the cloud side, and
the client side. The development of a complete IoT application
is very difficult for non-expert developers because it involves
drastically different technologies and complex interactions between
different sides. Unlike traditional IoT development platforms
which use separate approaches for these three sides, we present
TinyLink 2.0, an integrated IoT development approach with a single
coherent language. It achieves high expressiveness for diverse
IoT applications by an enhanced IFTTT rule design and a virtual
sensor mechanism which helps developers express application
logic with machine learning. Moreover, TinyLink 2.0 optimizes
the IoT application performance by using both static and dynamic
optimizers, especially for resource-constrained IoT devices. We
implement TinyLink 2.0 and evaluate it with eight case studies, a
user study, and a detailed evaluation of the proposed programming
language as well as the performance optimizers. Results show that
TinyLink 2.0 can speed up IoT development significantly compared
with existing approaches from both industry and academia, while
still achieving high expressiveness.</p>

    	  	<p>Low-power and multihop wireless networking is
envisioned as a promising technology to achieve both energy
efficiency and easy deployment for many Internet of Things
(IoT) applications. Measuring packet-level path is crucial for
managing large-scale multihop wireless networks. Packet-level
path information encodes the routing path, a packet that takes
through a network. The availability of packet-level path information
can greatly facilitate many network management tasks. It is
challenging to reconstruct packet-level paths using a small overhead,
especially for large-scale networks. While there is a long
list of existing path reconstruction algorithms, these algorithms
focus on specific network scenarios, e.g., periodic monitoring networks
or event detection networks. There lacks a unified model
for systematically understanding and comparing the performance
of these algorithms in different network scenarios. In this paper,
we fill this gap by proposing an abstract model. Using this model,
it is possible to derive a decision space for selecting the best
algorithm for different networks. Furthermore, this model also
guides us to devise better path reconstruction algorithms (cPath_T,
cPath_S, and cPath_ST ) with respect to path reconstruction ratio.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the prediction power of our
model as well as the advantages of our proposed algorithms.
The results show that our algorithm (cPath_ST ) improves a
path reconstruction ratio from 94.4%, 34.3%, and 30.8% to
98.9%, 99.9%, and 60.1% on average in three network scenarios,
respectively, compared with the best state-of-the-art algorithms.</p>

    	  	<p>Rapid development is essential for IoT (Internet of Things) application developers to obtain first-mover advantages and reducethe development cost. In this paper, we present TinyLink, a holisticsystem for rapid development of IoT applications. The key ideaof TinyLink is to use atop-down approach for designing boththe hardware and the software of IoT applications. Developers write the application code in a C-like language to specify the key logic of their applications, without dealing with the details of the specific hardware components. Taking the application code as input, TinyLink automatically generates the hardware configuration as well as the binary program executable on the target hardware platform. TinyLink provides unified APIs forapplications to interact with the underlying hardware components.We implement TinyLink and evaluate its performance using real-world IoT applications. Results show that: (1) TinyLink achieves rapid development of IoT applications, reducing 52.58% of lines of code in average compared with traditional approaches; (2) TinyLink searches a much larger design space and thus can generate a superior solution for the hardware configuration, compared with the state-of-the-art approach; (3) TinyLink incurs acceptable overhead in terms of execution time and program memory.</p>

    	  	<p>The ZigBee communication can be easily and severely interfered by Wi-Fi traffic. Error recovery, as an important means forZigBee to survive Wi-Fi interference, has been extensively studied in recent years. The existing works add upfront redundancy to in-packet blocks for recovering a certain number of random corruptions. Therefore the bursty nature of ZigBee in-packet corruptions under Wi-Fi interference is often considered harmful, since some blocks are full of errors which cannot be recovered and some blocks have no errors but still requiring redundancy. As a result, they often use interleaving to reshape the bursty errors, before applying complex FEC codes to recover the re-shaped random distributed errors. In this paper, we take a different view that burstiness may be helpful. With burstiness, the in-packet corruptions are often consecutive and the requirement for error recovery is reduced as "recovering any k consecutive errors" instead of "recovering any random k errors". This lowered requirement allows us to design far more efficient code than the existing FEC codes. Motivated by this implication, we exploit the corruption burstiness to design a simple yet effective error recovery code using XOR operations (called ZiXOR). ZiXOR uses XOR code and the delay is significantly reduced. More, ZiXOR uses RSSI-hinted approach to detect in packet corruptions without CRC, incurring almost no extra transmission overhead. The testbed evaluation results show that ZiXOR outperforms the state-of-the-art works in terms of the throughput (by 47%) and latency (by 22%).</p>

    	  	<p>Air  quality  monitoring  has  attracted  a  lot  of attention from governments, academia and industry, especially for PM2.5 due to its significant impact on our respiratory systems. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of Mosaic, a low cost urban PM2.5 monitoring system based on mobile sensing. In Mosaic, a small number of air quality monitoring nodes are deployed on city buses to measure air quality. Current low-cost particle sensors based on light-scattering, however, are vulnerable to airflow disturbance on moving vehicles. In order to address this problem, we build our air quality monitoring nodes, Mosaic-Nodes, with a novel constructive airflow-disturbance design based on a carefully tuned airflow structure and a GPS-assisted filtering method. Further, the buses used for system deployment are selected by a novel algorithm which achieves both high coverage and low computation overhead. The collected sensor data is also used to calculate the PM2.5 of locations without direct measurements by an existing inference model. We apply the Mosaic system in a testing urban area which includes more than 70 point-of-interests. Results show that the Mosaic system can accurately obtain the urban air quality with high coverage and low cost.</p>

    	  	<p>Network  measurement,  which  provides  detailed information about the behaviors of operational networks, is essential for network management in wireless sensor networks. In the literature, there have been many approaches focusing on measuring individual aspect of the network, e.g., per-packet routing path and per-hop delay. However, there lacks a general support for conducting different measurement tasks. When managing an operational network, a network operator often needs to switch the current measurement task to a different one,in order to diagnose the observed symptoms. In this paper, we propose TinySDM, a software-defined  measurement  architecturefor WSNs. TinySDM provides a general support for conducting different measurement tasks. TinySDM defines a set of carefully selected hooks that allow the users to easily execute their own measurement tasks. In addition, TinySDM provides a C-like language called TinyCode Language (TCL) to enable easy customization of measurement tasks. By only transmitting the binary code of the measurement task, TinySDM significantly reduces the size of the disseminated data compared with existing reprogramming approaches. We implement TinySDM on theTinyOS/TelosB platform and evaluate its performance extensively in a testbed with 60 nodes. We also use TCL to implement four specific measurement tasks. Results show that TinySDM is flexible, efficient and easily programmable.</p>

    	  	<p>Understanding the packet delivery performance of a wireless sensor network (WSN) iscritical for improving system performance and exploring future developments and applicationsof WSN techniques. In spite of many empirical measurements inthe literature, we still lack in-depth understanding on how and to what extent different factors contribute to the overall packet losses for a complete stack of protocols at large scale. Specifically, very little is known about: 1) when, where, and under what kind of circumstances packet losses occur; 2) why packets are lost. As a step toward addressing those issues, we deploy a large-scale WSN and design a measurement system for retrieving important system metrics. We propose MAP, a step-by-step methodology to identify the losses, extract system events, and perform spatial-temporal correlation analysis by employing a carefully examined causal graph.MAP enables us to get a closer look at the root causes of packetlosses in a low-power ad hoc network. This study validates some earlier conjectures on WSNs and reveals some newfindings. The quantitative results also shed lights for future large-scale WSN deployments.</p>

    	  	<p>Recent advances in Microelectronic Mechanical Systems (MEMS) and wireless communication technologies have fostered the rapid development of networked embedded systems like wireless sensor networks. System software for these self-organizing systems often needs to be updated for a variety of reasons. We present a holistic software update (i.e., reprogramming) system called R3 for networked embedded systems. R3 has two salient features. First, the binary differencing algorithm within R3 (R3diff) ensures an optimal result in terms of the delta size under a configurable cost measure. Second, the similarity preserving method within R3 (R3sim) optimizes the binary code format for achieving a large similarity with a small meta data overhead. Overall, R3 achieves the smallest delta size compared with other software update approaches such as Stream, Rsync, RMTD, Zephyr, Hermes, and R2 (e.g., 50%–99% reduction compared to Stream and about 20%–40% reduction compared to R2). R3's implementation on TelosB/TinyOS is lightweight and efficient.</p>

To address these issues, we present SenSpire OS, a predictable,flexible, and efficient operating system for wireless sensor networks. We improve system predictability by two-phase interrupt servicing and predictable thread synchronization; we achieve system flexibility by providing a hybrid model for both event-driven programming and multithreaded programming; we retain system efficiency by employing stack sharing and modular design. Moreover, we have designed a three-layer networking stack and an object-oriented programming language (CSpire) to enhance system usability and programming convenience.

Elon reduces the transferred code size significantly by introducing the concept of replaceable component. It avoids the cost of hardware reboot with a novel software reboot mechanism. Moreover, itsignificantly prolongs the reprogrammable lifetime (i.e., the time period during which the sensor nodes canbe reprogrammed) by avoiding flash writes for TelosB nodes. Experimental results show that Elon transfersup to 120–389 times less information than Deluge, and 18–42 times less information than Stream. The software reboot mechanism that Elon applies reduces the rebooting cost by 50.4%–53.87% in terms of beaconpackets, and 56.83% in terms of unsynchronized nodes.
